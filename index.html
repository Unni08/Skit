Km, which is about 21.71% of the country’s geographical area, as of February 2023. But over the last 3 years, 87 projects have been granted environmental clearance and 2.3 million trees have been marked to be cut down. If this continues, we would be a ‘Breathless’ country in a few decades.
<div>Many people have taken to protecting trees and there have been several movements for the same. Telling about them all will take quite some time. So, here, we would like to enact a few of them, which have earned a name for a safer life.</div></h4>

</div><div><em>(On the day, the people stood as Sunderlalji said. The contractors couldn’t cut down the trees.)
